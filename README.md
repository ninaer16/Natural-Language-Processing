Language Transliteration from English Loan Words to Thai
Transliteration is the process of converting from one text/script to another by swapping or replacing the letters of the source with the target text/script. For example, the Arabic script بي كتا (i.e., written) can be converted to the Latin script kitabi for English or, the Greek word Ελευθερία when transliterated into English becomes Eleutheria. Other uses of transliteration include mapping between loanwords from the language of origin to another.
English words have also been commonly used in a various international language as loan/borrowed words such as for technical terms (e.g., ‘computer’) or names of places (e.g., ‘New York’). Although different languages may have different pronunciations and sound inventories, some phonetic equivalents can be applied to a target language written in the script of the target language. For example, the English loan word fitness is written into Latin alphabet as ฟิตเนส (fít-nèet) in Thai.

Submit the following for your assignment:
i) a modified python FST program (based on the file recognize-sol2.py in italeem) for the Thai- English transliterations.
ii) an output file that prints the mappings of the transliterations as shown in Figure 1
iii) an FST construction generated by the Python program – Tkinter (attach image or paste image on word document)
